# useInsertionEffect

useInsertionEffect is a special-purpose hook that is used to inject styles into the DOM before layout and paint, like CSS-in-JS libraries.

> It ensures that your styles are inserted synchronously and before the browser paints so that there is not visual flicker or unstyled content.

It was introduced in React 18, and was intended for CSS-in-JS libraries like Emotion and styled-components.

<Callout type="warning">
  useInsertionEffect was not intended for general app logic.
</Callout>

## When to use it

1. When you are building a CSS-in-JS library or tool.
2. When you need to insert styles into the DOM before the browser paints.
3. When you want to prevent a Flash Of Unstyled Content (FOUC).

> Most React developers never even need to use this hook. I have never bothered with this hook up until now, and I am only using it in order to better write this book.

## Syntax

```js copy
useInsertionEffect(() => {
  // Insert styles here (e.g., add a <style> tag to the head)
  return () => {
    // Optional cleanup
  };
}, [dependencies]);
```

Similar to other hooks that require a dependency array, it only runs when the value of the dependency changes.

The useInsertionEffect hook behaves similarly to [useEffect](/useeffect) and [useLayoutEffect](/uselayouteffect), but it runs even earlier than both those hooks, because it runs right after DOM mutations, but before the browser paints.

### Example

This example demonstrates how you would use this hook in a CSS-in-JS library:

```js copy
import { useInsertionEffect } from 'react';

function useCustomStyle(styleString) {
  useInsertionEffect(() => {
    // creating the <style> tag in the head of your document
    const styleTag = document.createElement('style');
    styleTag.textContent = styleString;
    document.head.appendChild(styleTag);

    return () => {
      // Cleanup function
      document.head.removeChild(styleTag);
    };
  }, [styleString]);
}

// Styles
function StyledBox() {
  useCustomStyle(`
    .styled-box {
      background-color: lightblue;
      padding: 20px;
    }
  `);

  return <div className="styled-box">I am styled!</div>;
}
```

The above example ensures that the styles are injected **before** the component renders, such that you will not be able to see the unstyled box at all.
