import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

# usePathname

<Callout type="info">
  This hook is only available in NextJs (App Router)
</Callout>

The usePathname hook returns the current URL pathname, that is, the part of the URL after the domain name, but not including query parameters or hash segments (#section).

It is also imported from `next/navigation`.

**Example:**

```js
"use client";

import { usePathname } from "next/navigation";

export default function CurrentPath() {
  const pathname = usePathname();

  return <p>You are currently at: {pathname}</p>;
}
```

If you have the following code inside a path like `/dashboard/profiles`, the output will be:

```bash
You are currently at: /dashboard/profiles
```

<Callout type="info">usePathname always returns a string</Callout>

## Use cases

1. When you want to conditionally render the UI on the current route.
2. You want to highlight active links, such as on a sidebar or navigation menu.
3. You want to track the page the user is on.
4. You want to get the full static pathname (such as in the example above).

## Examples

### Hightlight active link

```js copy
"use client";

import Link from "next/link";
import { usePathname } from "next/navigation";

export default function Navbar() {
  const pathname = usePathname();

  return (
    <nav>
      <Link href="/" className={pathname === "/" ? "text-blue-500" : ""}>
        Home
      </Link>
      <Link
        href="/about"
        className={pathname === "/about" ? "text-blue-500" : ""}
      >
        About
      </Link>
    </nav>
  );
}
```

We are checking whether the pathname is the same as the current path that the user is on, and then applying custom styles to highlight the link.

### Conditionally render the UI

```js copy
"use client";

import { usePathname } from "next/navigation";

export default function Banner() {
  const pathname = usePathname();

  if (pathname === "/login" || pathname === "/register") {
    return null; // hide banner on auth pages
  }

  return <div>Welcome to our site!</div>;
}
```

In the example above, we are checking whether the user is currently on the login or register page, and then we are hiding the banner. If not, the banner is displayed.

### Logging page view for analytics

Using this example, you can set up an analytics service so that every page the user visits will be logged. Notice that we need to use the useEffect hook also.

```js copy
"use client";

import { useEffect } from "react";
import { usePathname } from "next/navigation";

export default function PageLogger() {
  const pathname = usePathname();

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log(`Page changed to: ${pathname}`);
    // send to analytics service here
  }, [pathname]);

  return null;
}
```
