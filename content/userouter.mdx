import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

# useRouter

<Callout type="info">
  This hook is only available in NextJs (App Router)
</Callout>

The useRouter hook gives you programmatic control over routing in your NextJs application. With this hook, you can:

1. Navigate between pages.
2. Go back in history.
3. Refresh the current route.
4. Replace the URL without reload.
5. Get the current path (using [usePathname](/usepathname))

When you are using the App router, import useRouter as follows:

```js copy
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";
```

When you are using the pages router, import useRouter as follows:

```js copy
import { useRouter } from "next/router";
```

## Syntax

```js
const router = useRouter();
```

Once you do this, you get access to the following functions:

| Function              | Description                                                                                                       |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `router.push(url)`    | Navigate to a new URL (adds to the history stack). Takes in a url string of the new page you want to navigate to. |
| `router.replace(url)` | Navigate to the new page without adding to the history stack. Takes in a url string.                              |
| `router.back()`       | Go back to the previous page in history stack. Does not take any parameter.                                       |
| `router.refresh()`    | Refresh the current page. Does not take in any parameter.                                                         |

## Examples

### Navigate after form submission

If you wanted to navigate to a new page after a user signs up, you could do something like this:

```js copy
"use client";

import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";

function SignupForm() {
  const router = useRouter();

  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    // handle logic...
    router.push("/dashboard"); // go to dashboard after signup
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input type="text" placeholder="Name" />
      <button type="submit">Sign Up</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  Notice the `use client` directive at the top of the file. Since NextJs is
  server-rendered by default, you cannot use any hooks in it because hooks are
  client-side only. Therefore, you need to tell NextJs that this is a client
  component by adding the `use client` directive.
</Callout>

## Going back to the previous page

Go back to the previous page when you click the button.

```js copy
"use client";

import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";

export default function GoBackButton() {
  const router = useRouter();

  return <button onClick={() => router.back()}>&larr; Go Back</button>;
}
```

This is basically like the browser's Back button.

## Replace the URL

`router.replace` works almost like `router.push`. The difference is that when you replace the URL, you cannot navigate back to the previous page. But with push, you can navigate back.

```js copy
"use client";

import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";

function SignupForm() {
  const router = useRouter();

  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    // handle logic...
    router.replace("/dashboard"); // go to the dashboard after signup
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input type="text" placeholder="Name" />
      <button type="submit">Sign Up</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```
